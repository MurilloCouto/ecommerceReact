# Ecommerce using ReactJS

A Market Place made with ReactJs, the focus was on studying routes using the react router dom and the use of props to load components dynamically, pulling data from a mock. The site does not have any type of verification for logging in or even features other than selecting the item of clothing and forwarding it to payment.
